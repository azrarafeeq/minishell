# minishell

Minishell is a small but mighty project that reinvents what a computer system's shell can do. Minishell is a tiny shell that allows users to communicate with their operating system via a command-line interface. This project, which was created with an emphasis on simplicity and efficiency, offers basic shell functions that let users easily manage processes, explore their file system, and run commands.
